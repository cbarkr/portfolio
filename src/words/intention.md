# Intention

Design does not disclose itself to the world. A designer ideates, reiteratively revises their idea, hates everything, starts over, and repeats until their vision is formed. They start with intention; a compulsion to convey something. Execution of that idea, however, determines how that message is ultimately conveyed. 

I neither claim to be nor think of myself as a designer, but I enjoy pretending to be one sometimes (after all, mimicry is the first step to mastery). In particular, I try to follow Dieter Rams' principles of design. Why these specific principles? They just make sense to me.

Ideally, everything I output conveys even an iota of the intention I initially input. In practical settings, this means making things as simple, easy to understand, and useful as possible. More specifically:
- When I code, I strive to write it as functionally, efficiently, and elegantly as possible without sacrificing readability
- When I design, I tend towards straightforward (at times, brutal) compositions

For example, I tried to do so with this very site. The arrow motif is intended to guide the viewer between each page and/or component. Within each page, too, I avoided scrolling wherever possible -- since I find it all too easy to mindlessly scroll, completely missing the content flashing right in front of your eyes -- so rather than displaying my photography as a gallery, I opted for click-based interaction (try it out for yourself!). I hope subsequent updates to this site will further convey my intentions. For now, I blame all flaws and/or inaccuracies on poor execution :P
