# Intention

There is a strange beauty in brutalism that is often overlooked. Beneath and between the prefabricated concrete slabs, there lies great intention and execution: low-cost, simple, and robust structures. This design strategy helped rehouse a large portion of the Soviet population after war razed their cities. This is good design in action. But more often than not, it goes unnoticed. Many complain about the appearance of the concrete monoliths of old, failing to appreciate the beauty that their existence has created. Yet, they remain useful, thus they remain beautiful. This is good design in action.

Dieter Rams (and many more before him) appreciated such things. His ten principles of good design are timeless and universal (replacing "good design" with simply "good" converts most of the principles to general goodness criteria for life). These ideas have inspired countless creatives in the past and will likely continue to inspire those to come. 

What does this mean to me? A lot. It means that I try to adhere to these principles with everything I create. When I write code, I try to write it as functionally, efficiently,  and elegantly as possible without sacrificing readability. When I design something, I tend towards simplicity, usability, and intuitability. These sorts of things. 

For example, I tried to do so with this very site. The arrow motif is supposed to guide the viewer between each page and component. Within each page, too, I avoided scrolling wherever possible -- since I find it all too easy to mindlessly scroll, completely missing the content flashing right in front of your eyes -- so rather than displaying my photography as a gallery, I wanted to utilize click-based interaction. Try it out for yourself :)

In short: if you are gonna do something, do it with intention down to the very last detail.
