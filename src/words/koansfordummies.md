# Koans for Dummies

_(I am the dummy)_

## Who are you?

Obviously I am me, myself.

### Layer:01

To be my _self_ is to be an individual. And to be an individual is to be indivisible. I am not a dividual, an aggregation of attributes, as some social media services may perceive me to be. But to be an individual, to be indivisible, is to be non-introspectible. When the surface is opaque, there is no further to look.

I knew this, yet for days, perhaps weeks, I kept trying. With this black box called _self_, I hoped to find a contradiction. The best I came up with was "I am all but those who I am not"; a tautology.

### Layer:02

I then asked _what_ "I" really is. Is my _self_ my body? my mind? my consciousness? I rediscovered the mind-body problem. Recalling Clark and Chalmer's _extended mind thesis_ (EMT), I thought that the _self_ may overflow from one's body, mind, or consciousness. "I" may exist, at least partially, in a notebook or someone else's mind. From this perspective, selfhood appears to be a contradiction; I mean, if I extend past myself, am I really me? Rather, does not this contradiction imply the nonexistence of the _self_ in the first place? Am I _nobody_?

Unbecoming (i.e. dissolution of the self; ego-death) is sought in Zen practice. Since my conclusion vaguely aligned with the idea of unbecoming, I assumed it was correct. Relieved, I considered this my first _kensho_ (insight, awakening, etc.) and carried on.

However, I grew dissatisfied with my answer. It was not some "ah-ha!" or "eureka!" moment. It was merely the recollection of a thought once past in a philosophy class.

Further, I interpret _nobody_ as no-body (i.e. **physical** nonexistence). The contrapositive is that having a body implies that one is _somebody_. But a body alone is insufficient for selfhood. One, aided by future technologies that allow them to abandon the flesh \[Lain\] or transfer their consciousness to an unnatural body \[GITS\], would remain themselves. The _self_, whether that be consciousness, memory, mind, environment (per the EMT), etc., or any combination thereof, is manifest elsewhere.

Unless I am a brain in a vat or AI or some other bizarre body-less scenario, I cannot truly be _nobody_. However, I am quite confident in my body's existence. This body, conversely, does not make me _somebody_. On its own, it means nothing.

(Of course, had I used _no-one_ instead of _no-body_, this crisis would have been averted.)

### Layer:03

After some time, I revisited the question. My new strategy was to take another step back. Asking myself "who am I?", to which I respond "nobody; a contradiction", is a paradox! If, instead of asking the question to myself, I were to ask it to another person, to which they respond "nobody", I might find them rather odd. Not only do they have a body, but also the facilities to perceive the world and act on those perceptions. They think therefore they are. Yet, they state otherwise.

The statement itself is paradoxical, I think that much is clear. What remains translucent is the implication: since the statement concerns personhood, does it imply the subject themselves is a paradox? Can one be a paradox? To be, _and_ not to be, that is the question.

To answer the question: no. One cannot not be one. To observe one, as oneself, is to confirm one's existence and thereby disprove one's nonexistence.

Metaphorically speaking, however, one can be paradoxical. Consider the following examples:

1. Fictional characters are personified to the extent that viewers relate to and/or care about them, and speak of them as if they are real. In the mind of the viewer, the nonexistent is existent.
2. Suppose there exists some hyper-realistic AI model that, in real-time, outputs video and audio that looks and sounds like a real person, and possesses both memory and (simulated) consciousness. If one were to unknowingly communicate and develop relations with this AI model (i.e. part of the model's "_self_" exists within this person), would not the person interacting with the AI model also believe it to be a person?

In both examples, the subject exists purely in the virtual domain. But they are exactly that: virtual. They exist only in essence, not form. In the real domain, one cannot be a paradox in and of itself.

### Layer:04

Some more time passed. No new _kensho_ arrived. I started losing hope.

Was this a trick question? Probably not. But could it have an illogical answer (or an answer acquired via illogical methods)? This seemed far more likely. Of course, problems of this nature are not logically deducible.

Yet, I had taken an entirely logical approach. I took, perhaps, the inhuman approach. We are somewhat logical creatures, but we are not rational agents by any means. We are often irrational, emotional, incomprehensible beings. At times, it may be necessary to embrace this nature.

The way forward must therefore be backward.

New strategy: Abandon strategy.

As I had rationalized originally, I am in-dividual; thus, introspection is impossible. Conversely, the hard problems must be met with an empty mind.

I let the question "who am I?" float around my head like incense smoke. It dangled itself in front of me, but I had to resist the urge to grasp it. Again, I waited. In subsequent meditations, I focused on leaving the question just out of focus. Nothing happened, really. But as an exercise in patience, I continued on. Eventually, that nothing felt like something. Something crept up on me. Then, suddenly, as if I were tapped me on the shoulder before the culprit escaped unseen, there was a fleeting moment of understanding. It was frustratingly elusive.

The only thing I could do was carry on and hope that feeling returned. It was not some conscious process that I could simply resume, it had to return itself to me. Again, it was silent.

Slowly, that feeling crept up on me once more. This time quicker than the last, I felt like I was really on to something. Or rather, something was on to me?

And it was. At last, it made sense. As elusive as it was attainable; as silent as it was loud and clear: the complete nothingness, expressed in such clarity by my subconscious, was the answer all along. It was a profound realization. I am not somebody, nor nobody, nor some paradoxical combination or negation of the two. I just _am_. Much like the flora and fauna inhabiting this earth long before I, I am present; but there need not be concern for the _I_ alone.

Beyond reason, it may be, but this explanation felt more reasonable than any feeble logic I could construct. Consider it intuition. I sure as hell will not be able to explain it anytime soon.
